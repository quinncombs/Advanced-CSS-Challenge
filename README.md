# Advanced-CSS-Challenge

## Description
This is my first website made with no starter code, about two weeks into learning web development. It combines HTML with CSS using flexbox, media queries, a usable navigation bar and styling. This is an easy way to find out more about me, see my work, and ways to contact me all in one spot.

## Usage
Use the navigation bar on the top right side of the screen to navigate to the different categories listed. This box will stay at the top of the screen when you scroll down. Clicking on the boxes in the "My Work" section will open the projects associated. There is only one now, but I will continue updating it as I learn different languages and enhance my skills. This website will still be usuable on a smaller screen.
